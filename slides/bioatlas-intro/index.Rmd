## Introduce ALA and current status including deployments

## Docker Fundamentals - What is it and why use it?

## Compare deployment models (Ansible, Docker) and when each one is suitable

## Makefile

Tool for generation of executables and other non-source files from source files

- Build and install your programs / packages , control installing or deinstalling a package

- updates target based on changes in the source files

- Not limited to any particular language

## Makefile
Makefile consists of explicit rules, implicit rules, variable definitions, directives, and comments.

**Rules**
```
target … : prerequisites …
        recipe
        …
        …
        
content.zip: content
  cd content && zip -r ../content.zip .

release: build push

stop:
  @echo "Stopping services..."
  @docker-compose stop
```

## Makefile
**Phony Targets**

Not a file; a name for a recipe to be executed
```
.PHONY: all
all: init build up

.PHONY: clean
clean:
        rm *.o temp
```

**Variable definition**
```
TS = $(shell date '+%Y_%m_%d_%H_%M')
```

## Makefile
**Directive**

A directive is an instruction for make to do something special while reading the makefile

Including other makefiles
```
include filenames…
```

Conditional checks
```
conditional-directive
text-if-true
else
text-if-false
endif
```

## Makefile
**Comments**
 
```
secrets:
  # Make this unique, and don't share it with anybody.
  # This value was autogenerated."
  printf "export SECRET_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=%b\n" \
  $$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | head -c 50) >> $@
```

## Docker Introduction

## Dockerfile
Contains commands to assemble an image. ```docker build```  to create an automated build that executes instructions in succession.

**Format**
```
# Comment
INSTRUCTION arguments
```

## Dockerfile
**FROM**

Set the base image for subsequent instructions.
```
FROM tomcat:7-alpine
```
**RUN**

Execute a command on top of an existing layer and create a new layer with the result.
```
FROM tomcat:7-alpine
RUN mkdir -p /data \
	/data/generic-collectory 
```
## Dockerfile
**CMD**

Specifies the intended command for the image. Whereas RUN actually executes the command during build time.
```
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
```
**LABEL**

Assign metadata in the form of key-value pairs to the.
```
LABEL version="1.0" description="This is a sample desc"
```

## Dockerfile
**EXPOSE**

Specifie the port for the container to listen on.
```
EXPOSE 8983
EXPOSE 7000 7001 7199 9042 9160

```
**ENV**

Set the environment variables in the container.
```
ENV SOLR_USER solr
ENV SOLR_UID 8983
```
## Dockerfile
**COPY**

Copy files and directories from a specified source to a destination in the container.
```
COPY collectory.war $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/
```

**ADD**

Similar to the COPY instruction with few added features like remote 
URL support in the source field and local-only tar extraction. 
```
ENV TINI_VERSION v0.10.0
ADD https://github.com/krallin/tini/releases/download/${TINI_VERSION}/tini /tini
```
## Dockerfile
**ENTRYPOINT**

Set the primary command for the image.
```
ENTRYPOINT ["tini", "--", "docker-entrypoint.sh"]
```
**VOLUME**

Create a mount point with the specified name and marks it as holding 
externally mounted volumes from native host or other containers.
```
VOLUME /data/images/store
VOLUME /var/lib/cassandra
```
## Dockerfile
**USER**

Set the UID or username to use when running the image.
```
USER $SOLR_USER
```

**WORKDIR**

Set the currently active directory for other instructions.
```
WORKDIR /opt/solr
```
## Dockerfile
**ONBUILD**

Adds a trigger instruction to be executed when the image 
is used as the base for some other image. 
```
ONBUILD RUN rm -rf /usr/temp
```

## Dockerfile
**Example**
```
FROM tomcat:7-alpine
RUN mkdir -p /data \
	/data/logger/config
COPY logger-service.war $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/
ENV \
	BUILD_DEPS="gettext" \
	RUNTIME_DEPS="libintl"
RUN \
    apk add --update $RUNTIME_DEPS && \
    apk add --virtual build_deps $BUILD_DEPS &&  \
    cp /usr/bin/envsubst /usr/local/bin/envsubst && \
    apk del build_deps
RUN apk add --update tini
ENTRYPOINT ["tini", "--"]
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
```

## Docker Compose
Manage lifecycle of application:

- Start, stop and rebuild services
- View the status of running services
- Stream the log output of running services
- Run a one-off command on a service

## Docker Compose
Features

- Multiple isolated environments on a single host
- Preserve volume data when containers are created
- Only recreate containers that have changed
- Variables and moving a composition between environments

## Docker Compose
Compose file 

A YAML file defining services, networks and volumes. 

- Service configuration
- Volume configuration
- Network configuration
- secrets configuration

## Docker Compose
Example docker-compose file , small, one slide only

## Docker Hub

- A cloud-based registry service 
- Build, test, store images  
- Centralized resource for container image discovery, distribution and change management

**Features**

- Image Repository
- Automated Builds
- Webhooks
- Organizations
- Integration with code repositories

## Travis CI

- Continuous Integration service
- Build and test software projects hosted at GitHub
- Free for Open source projects 
- Configuration using .travis.yml, a YAML format text file

## Travis CI
Language specifics
```
language: groovy
jdk:
- oraclejdk7
sudo: false
```

## Travis CI

The Build Lifecycle has 2 steps:

install: install any dependencies required
    
script: run the build script

    apt addons
    cache components
    before_install
    install
    before_script
    script
    before_cache (for cleaning up cache)
    after_success or after_failure
    before_deploy
    deploy
    after_deploy
    after_script

## Travis CI
Installing dependencies
```
before_install:
- export TZ=Europe/Stockholm
- date
- rm -rf ~/.sdkman
- curl -s http://get.sdkman.io | bash
- echo "sdkman_auto_answer=true" > ~/.sdkman/etc/config
- source ~/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh
- GRAILS_VERSION=`grep '^app\.grails\.version=' ./application.properties | sed -e
  's/^app\.grails\.version=//g'`
- sdk install grails $GRAILS_VERSION || true
```

## Travis CI
Setup environment for build
```
before_script:
- GRAILS_VERSION_NUMBER=`echo $GRAILS_VERSION | sed -e 's/\.[0-9]*$//g' -e 's/\.//g' | tr -d "\r"`
- echo "GRAILS_VERSION_NUMBER:$GRAILS_VERSION_NUMBER"
- GRAILS_SETTINGS_FILE="travis_grails_settings_new.groovy"
- if [ "$GRAILS_VERSION_NUMBER" -lt "23" ]; then GRAILS_SETTINGS_FILE="travis_grails_settings_old.groovy"; fi;
- echo "GRAILS_SETTINGS_FILE:$GRAILS_SETTINGS_FILE"
- mkdir -p ~/.grails
- wget -q -O ~/.grails/settings.groovy https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/travis-build-configuration/master/$GRAILS_SETTINGS_FILE
```

## Travis CI
Custom build 
```
script:
- grails clean 
- grails refresh-dependencies --non-interactive
- grails prod war --non-interactive
```

## Travis CI
Deploy
```
deploy:
  provider: releases
  api_key:
    secure: YOUR_API_KEY_ENCRYPTED
  file_glob: true
  file: "target/generic-collectory-*.war"
  skip_cleanup: true
  overwrite: true
  on:
    repo: bioatlas/generic-collectory-sweden
    all-branches: true
